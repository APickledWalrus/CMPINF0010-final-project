## Datasets
Number of Police Arrests (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data)
- Record of all arrests by city police. Includes neighborhood.

Number of Firearm Seizures (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pbp-fire-arm-seizures/)
- A record of all firearm seizures by police. Includes data such as neighborhood, number of weapons seized, and types of weapons seized.

Number of Tobacco Shops (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-tobacco-vendors)
- A record of all tobacco shops in Allegheny County. This data set does *not* contain information about the neighborhood, so this will have to be determined during processing.

Property Assessments (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/property-assessments)
- A record of property assessments performed in the area. Includes lots of data about each data, but we specifically care about the [Parcel ID](https://www.encyclopedia.com/articles/how-to-find-a-property-parcel-number/) of each property, which we will use with the tobacco shops data set.
